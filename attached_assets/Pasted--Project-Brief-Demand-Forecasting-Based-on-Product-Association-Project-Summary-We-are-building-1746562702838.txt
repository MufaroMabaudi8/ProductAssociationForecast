üíº Project Brief: Demand Forecasting Based on Product Association
üß© Project Summary
We are building a web-based application that uses product association insights and historical sales data to forecast product demand more accurately. The platform should be interactive, data-driven, and user-friendly, with dashboards and visualizations to support business insights and inventory optimization.

üßæ Core Features & Pages
1. User Authentication
Signup Page: Allow new users to create accounts securely.

Login Page: Authenticate users with email/username and password.

(Optional) Password recovery and email verification for better security and UX.

2. Homepage
Clean landing page with a brief project description.

‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù button or link to the Dashboard.

Branding and system purpose overview.

3. Dashboard
The central area where users interact with data, models, and visualizations:

Demand Forecast Visualizations:

Line/bar charts showing historical and predicted demand.

Actual vs. predicted comparisons.

Product Association Visualizations:

Network graphs or market basket visualizations showing commonly co-purchased products.

Association rule summaries with support/confidence metrics.

Filters and Controls:

Time range, category selection, and product filters.

Interactive Insights:

Hover for details, drill-down on specific products or bundles.

4. Sidebar (Persistent Navigation Menu)

Project Objectives
Display these directly in the sidebar for context:

Improve demand forecasting accuracy

Analyze transaction data for product associations

Develop forecasting models that integrate association insights

Predict demand for individual and bundled products

Build dashboards to visualize trends and associations

Optimize inventory based on related product demand

üìà Demand Forecast Module (with Product Association Integration)
This is the core intelligence of the system and should be implemented in the backend with integrated visualization support on the dashboard.

üß† Key Components:
Input:

Upload transactional sales data (e.g., CSV with dates, product IDs, quantities).

Product Association Mining:

Apply algorithms like Apriori or FP-Growth to extract frequent itemsets and association rules.

Example rule: ‚ÄúCustomers who buy product A also buy product B 70% of the time.‚Äù

Forecasting Engine:

Use time series models like ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM to forecast demand.

Adjust predictions using association weights to estimate demand for co-purchased products.

Predict both individual product demand and bundle-level demand.

Outputs:

Dynamic graphs showing:

Standalone demand forecasts

Demand forecasts influenced by associated products

Numerical outputs, downloadable reports, and confidence intervals.

üîç Example Use Case:
Product A is forecasted to rise by 20% next month.

Product B is strongly associated with A (confidence = 80%).

System automatically forecasts increased demand for B as well, helping with bundle inventory planning.

‚öôÔ∏è Backend System Requirements
Data Upload & Preprocessing:

Clean uploaded data and validate format.

Association Rule Mining Service:

Compute and store relationships between products.

Forecasting Service:

Generate short- and long-term predictions.

Incorporate association relationships into model logic.

Database:

Store transaction data, association rules, forecast results.

üìä Visualization Tools
Demand Trends: Line/area charts (e.g., Chart.js, Plotly).

Association Maps: Network diagrams or force-directed graphs.

Bundle Demand View: Dual graphs showing side-by-side forecasts.
